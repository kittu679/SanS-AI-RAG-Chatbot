## üìú Project Overview

**SanS AI** is a conversational AI system designed to make the profound wisdom of ancient Sanskrit texts accessible to a modern audience. This is a self project by **K . Kiran, IIT Kanpur**.

It leverages a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture to provide accurate, context-aware, and citation-backed answers from a curated knowledge base of sacred Indian texts, including the **Bhagavad Gita, Ramayana, and the Yoga Sutras**.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.11+
-   A Google Gemini API Key

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    # For Windows
    python -m venv .venv
    .\.venv\Scripts\activate

    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    -   Create a new file named `.env` in the root of the project.
    -   Add your Google Gemini API key to this file:
        ```
        GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
        ```

5.  **Build the Knowledge Base:**
    -   Place your Sanskrit text files in the appropriate subdirectories within the `Corpus` folder (e.g., `Corpus/bhagavadgita`, `Corpus/ramayana`).
    -   Run the ingestion script to create the FAISS indexes. This only needs to be done once.
        ```bash
        python ingest.py
        ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn backend:app --reload
    ```
    The server will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

2.  **Launch the Frontend:**
    -   Open the `index.html` file in your web browser (using the "Open with Live Server" extension in VS Code is recommended).
